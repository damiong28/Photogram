A work-in-progress instagram clone. I am using the Devise gem for the first time and boy do I love it. Building your own authentication system is a lot of work. I like the devwalks tutorials as he doesn't hold your hand so much, just tells you what you need to do and lets you try on your own to get it done. I feel like I am learning a lot more this way, and it's a lot more satisfying!
